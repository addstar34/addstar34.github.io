Hello and welcome to my personal blog.

This blog will track my journey of learning. I will write mostly about programming, software development and tech start ups but I will also write about other things I'm interested in such as; health and fitness, financial markets, lifehacking and travel.

I'm using this blog as a way to help me lock in my learning or think out my thoughts but if something I write about helps you in some way, or you can help me improve my learning then please post a comment, <strong>comments give's dem good feels :relaxed:</strong>

<small><i>disclaimer: yes English is my native language but my grammar and spelling might not always be on point as I write just to get the thoughts out of head.</i></small>
