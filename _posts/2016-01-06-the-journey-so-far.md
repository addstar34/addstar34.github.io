Hello and welcome to my personal blog.

This blog will track my journey of learning. I will write mostly about programming, software development and tech start ups but I will also write about other things I'm interested in such as; health and fitness, financial markets, lifehacking and travel.

I'm going to be honest this blog is mostly for me, to help me lock in my learning or think out my thoughts BUT if something I write about helps you in some way, or you can help me improve my learning then please feel free to comment :)
